## Overview

The **Tech Book Club Landing Page** is a responsive web project designed to provide a seamless experience for users interested in joining a technology-focused book club. The landing page highlights key features of the club, membership options, and community engagement, while maintaining a visually appealing and accessible design.

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:
- View an optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

## My Process

### Built With
- **HTML5** - For structured and semantic markup.
- **CSS3** - Utilizing custom properties for maintainability.
- **Flexbox** - Ensuring a responsive and flexible layout.
- **Mobile-first workflow** - Designed to optimize for small screens first, then scaling up.

### What I Learned

During this project, I enhanced my understanding of **flexbox** for responsive layouts, applied a **mobile-first approach**, and improved accessibility considerations through well-structured HTML and semantic elements.

Example of a key CSS implementation:
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 20px;
}

.button {
  background-color: #ff6600;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: background 0.3s ease;
}

.button:hover {
  background-color: #cc5500;
}
```

### Continued Development

Moving forward, I aim to:
- Implement **CSS animations** for a more interactive user experience.
- Enhance **accessibility** using ARIA attributes.
- Experiment with **CSS Grid** to refine layouts.
